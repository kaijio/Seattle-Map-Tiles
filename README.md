# Seattle Map Tiles
## GEOG 458 Lab 4

In this lab, I have created my own map tilesets in QGIS and have layered them over a MapBox monochrome basemap. I have created my tilesets based on the Seattle area with a focus on library and park locations within the city. In creating my tiles, I have made each of the tilesets have a maximum zoom level of 14 in order to save time and storage. 

## Tiles:

1. Basemap. The first tileset is a monochrome basemap which comes from MapBox.

3. Libraries. The second tilesset contains the locations for Seattle Libraries, which are shown in brown dots.
4. Libraries + Basemap. The third tileset contains the library locations on top of the MapBox basemap I have created
5. Parks. The fourth tileset contains where Seattle parks are located, highlighted in green.
